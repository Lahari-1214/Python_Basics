# Tuples are sequence types in python which stores data or items(immutable)
# we can't perform append(),extend(), append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop() and clear() on tuples because tuples are immutable

# Creating Tuples
tup1 = ()  # empty touple 
tup2 = (10,)  # tuple with one element. Observe comma after the element.
tpl= tuple(range(4, 9, 2)) # numbers from 4 to 8 in steps of 2 
print(tpl)
